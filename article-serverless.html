              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Precision agriculture is no longer just a buzzword—it is a necessity. For our latest project, CHOMA SENSE, we set out to build a mobile solution that empowers farmers with real-time data on soil moisture and pH levels. But building an app that is both technically robust and user-friendly for farmers requires more than just code; it requires a carefully planned development cycle.</p>

              <p>Here is an inside look at how we built CHOMA SENSE, from the tech stack to the field tests at Sultan Kudarat State University.</p>

              <h2>1. The Blueprint: Our Tech Stack</h2>
              <p>To ensure the app was responsive and capable of handling real-time data, we chose a modern, efficient technology stack.</p>

              <h3>The Framework</h3>
              <p>We used Flutter (paired with the Dart language). This allowed us to build a cross-platform app that looks and feels native on any device.</p>

              <h3>The Engine</h3>
              <p>Visual Studio Code served as our primary web editing tool.</p>

              <h3>The Brains</h3>
              <p>We integrated Firebase for our backend. Firebase doesn't just store data; it allows for real-time synchronization. This means when a sensor detects a change in soil pH, the farmer sees it on their dashboard instantly. It also handles our user authentication, ensuring data remains secure.</p>

              <h2>2. The Process: Design Meets Function</h2>
              <p>We followed a strict Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We didn't want to just build a "tool"; we wanted to build an experience.</p>

              <p>Our focus wasn't immediately on the hardware sensors (though the system supports Bluetooth/Wi-Fi integration). Instead, we prioritized Software Integration and UX. We prototyped key features like data logging and chart rendering first. We knew that if the dashboard wasn't intuitive, it wouldn't be used.</p>

              <h2>3. Field Testing at SKSU</h2>
              <p>A theory is only as good as its practice. To validate CHOMA SENSE, we conducted a study at the Sultan Kudarat State University (SKSU) Administration Building in Tacurong.</p>

              <p>We utilized purposive sampling to find the perfect testers—people who actually understand the nuances of the problem we are solving:</p>

              <h3>The Users</h3>
              <p>8 Agriculture students provided feedback on how the app impacts farming methods.</p>

              <h3>The Experts</h3>
              <p>3 IT personnel evaluated the system's technical stability and code integrity.</p>

              <h2>4. Measuring Success</h2>
              <p>We didn't just ask, "Do you like it?" We used a rigorous rating scale questionnaire to measure four key pillars:</p>

              <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
              <p>Does it do the job?</p>

              <h3>Convenience</h3>
              <p>Is it easy to access?</p>

              <h3>Functionality</h3>
              <p>Do all features work as intended?</p>

              <h3>Efficiency</h3>
              <p>Does it perform without lag or errors?</p>

              <p>Using descriptive statistics, we analyzed the data to create a user satisfaction profile. This statistical treatment allowed us to move beyond guesswork and prove that CHOMA SENSE is a reliable, effective tool for modern farming.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>CHOMA SENSE is the result of merging agricultural science with computer engineering. By rigorously testing with real students and experts, we've created a foundation for smarter, data-driven farming.</p>
